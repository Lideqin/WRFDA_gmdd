# Project Title

Early development of RadarVar v1.0

## Getting Started

RadarVar v1.0 follows the reflectivity operator of Jung et al., 2008 (J08) and rewrites the formula for the tangent linear and adjoint opearotrs. The hail coefficients (alphaxa alphaxb) of J08 are replaced with graupel coefficients calculated using backscatter amplitude data in pyCAPS.
